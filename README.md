Pebble (smartwatch) application which displays text sent from your smartphone.
The original purpose of this app is to ease one's life at school.

This is only Pebble application, the android application source code has not been published yet.
It is (and it will probably also remain) WIP. The transfer of data from smartphone to the Pebble app is not working correctly.

Compilation and installation
----------------------------
1. set up your Pebble SDK
2. use SDK 2.x (tested with 2.9) -> pebble sdk activate 2.9
3. pebble build
4. pebble install --phone 192.168.1.174

SDK 3.x / 4.x
-------------
Port to SDK 3.x or 4.x would be welcomed, feel free to contribute.
